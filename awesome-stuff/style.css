Welcome to (or possibly, back to) our website, which has one of the silliest names on earth. At least it looks nice, and has a good ol' fashioned mouseover (redirect, header title), so we're good for now. Anyway, we're wondering - is this bar of 'endless detail' even necessary? According to our brains, no. But it still exists, and we probably won't remove it. Here's who 'we' are;
<p>-----</p>
Me (ComicSketchAnonymous),
<p> </p>
Crisco,
<p> </p>
Suma-White-Lion,
<p> <p>
PixelThousand,
<p> </p>
And finally, my (very helpful) parents, who are editors - LovelyLemon and Actdorky
<p>-----</p>
They're the <strong> admins </strong> - clever people who help power this website. They're off for lunch now ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
